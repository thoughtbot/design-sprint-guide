## Deploy Previews

Netlify will automatically deploy previews when you push up new code, when you
open a pull request the integration will comment with a link that you can use
to view the deploy. You can also see the preview before opening a pull request
by logging into Netlify and navigating to the 'deploys' tab for the site, or
using the following format:

```
branch--yoursitename.netlify.app
```

## Deploy to Production

The site will deploy to production every time new commits are added to the `main` branch.
